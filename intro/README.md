_**Disclaimer**: The game file **superstore_showdown.owl** is in progress and will be done soon._

In this GitHub repository, I have uploaded two game files through **YouthDigital**'s OWL Game Creator. 

The first file, **europa.owl**, is a first-person game in which you have been stranded on Europa, one of Jupiter's four biggest moons, because your ship (seen as an airplane) malfunctioned and crashed en route to Pluto to evacuate from an alien invasion of Earth. Unfortunately, the aliens are after you, which is why you must now evacuate from Europa. To do so, you need to go through a maze with multiple obstacles, at which the end of which your prize will be a new spaceship. The question is will you be able to go through the maze and find this spaceship on time, or will you be invaded by aliens on Europa?

The second file **superstore_showdown.owl** is not yet finished but will be soon. Although the overall conflict has developed, this game is not as nail-biting as **europa.owl** but retains its concept. In this game, you go through multiple supermarkets like *Target*, *Walmart*, *Sam's Club*, *Publix*, *Kroger*, etc. to buy specific items for your mother. Here's the twist: You only have five minutes to do all of your shopping, or you will die (and I am not joking, since you have only five minutes to complete any OWL game, but you would respawn a) where you started off or b) where your last hit a checkpoint).

Overall, you can play these game files by uploading them to your **YouthDigital** account. I highly recommend them both (though you may or may not want to play **superstore_showdown.owl** because this game is still a WIP).

Thank you!
